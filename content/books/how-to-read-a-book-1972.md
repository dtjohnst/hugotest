A detailed treatise on how to effectively read any type of book. Excellent points but long-winded from the mid-point on. Fantastic reading list in Appendix A.

## Key Ideas
* Reading takes conscious effort
* There are 4 stages of reading
	* Elementary - Cursory look
	* Inspectional - Skimming
	* Analytical - Detailed analysis
	* Syntopical - Reading several books on a topic
* Make notes
* The reader bears as much responsibility as the author
* Criticism can only follow understanding
* Knowledge is commulative
* You must read books that challenge you
